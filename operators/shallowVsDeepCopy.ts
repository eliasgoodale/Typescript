	A shallow copy is a bitwise copy of the object. A new object is returned that has an exact
	copy of the values in the original object. If any fields of the object are references to other objects,
	just the reference addresses are copied. A deep copy in contrast, copies everything through the object
	and returns a new object with all the values of the object being copied

	Shallow copy example: All the fields in the object are copied by reference, if the original object 
	disappears, so does the new object
